<p>This folder is accessible using the path /assets/media/html/<file_name> and the content index page is displayed. It does not require authentication.</p>

<h3>THAT MEANS ANYTHING PUT HERE IS OPEN TO PUBLIC</h3>
<h2>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! USE IT WISELY</h2>

To put static files which also requires authenticate, at the application root dir, create a folder `Private` and put the files there. The files in the `Private` folder will be accessible only after authentication.
